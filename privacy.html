      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>Rush Lines Inc is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") governs how we treat the Personal Information that we collect and receive from you in connection with your use of the SMS Service ("Service"), which we make available to you through a third-party service provider. This Policy is incorporated into the Terms of Service. Mobile opt-in will not be shared, and appears to allow for the sharing of data with other companies.</p>

      <p>By using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Policy. Rush Lines Inc reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or change this Policy at any time with or without prior notice to you. The date of the last update will be posted at the top of this Policy for your convenience. This Policy, and any changes, are effective as soon as posted. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Policy constitutes your full acceptance of those changes.</p>

      <p>"Personal Information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your mobile phone number or user/screen name, as well as any Personal Information that you choose to include in messages you send through the Service.</p>

      <h2>What Personal Information is collected about you</h2>

      <p>Through the use of the Service, Rush Lines Inc will receive the following information from our third party service provider: your mobile phone number when you send a text message to us, the text of messages that you send to other users of the Service, any user or screen name that you select in connection with the Service, as well as any comments or feedback regarding the Service that you send to us.</p>

      <h2>How Rush Lines Inc uses Personal Information about you</h2>

      <p>We use Personal Information to (a) provide you with the Service, (b) process and respond to inquiries, (c) improve the Service, (d) if necessary, contact you with important announcements or messages, (e) conduct research, and (f) provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients and partners.</p>

      <p>Each message that you send through the Service (either to us or to other users of the Service) is stored on our servers. We retain these messages on our servers. Rush Lines Inc utilizes servers and services owned by third parties.</p>

      <h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>

      <p>We will not rent or sell your Personal Information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may use or disclose such information in any of the following limited circumstances:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We have your consent.</li>
        <li>We need to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        <li>We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. If the third party fails to comply with our terms, Rush Lines Inc is not accountable in any way for any liability or reimbursement.</li>
        <li>We provide such information to third parties who have entered into non-disclosure agreements with us.</li>

        <li>We transfer Personal Information about you if Rush Lines Inc is, or its assets are, acquired by or merged with another company.</li>
      </ul>
